# 100% Loot
## Mains

## Ironman
To 100% guarantee the customer gets the loot, you will have to use lootshare in the `Grouping System`, where the person who deals the final damage will get the loot.

Lower down the boss's health to around 10k and teleport out. You can then already start a new instance to speed up the kills per hour significantly.

## Mains
On main accounts you'll have to ensure you have no teleport animation set in your wardrobe.
Teleport out at +- 40K HP left and lobby / log out. The reason you have to log out is because otherwise you'll be forcing the next staff piece you're supposed to get to the customer. If you log out you'll force their next piece and not the seller's next piece.
