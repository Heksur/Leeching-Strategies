# Ticketing System
This page will explain how to use our ticketing system as a seller. Remember: if you have any questions, feel free to tag Support or Moderators.

## Overview
When the customer creates a ticket and selects a service, a message will appear in the appropriate channel. For example: `#mainscape-orders`, `#ironman-orders` or `#skiller-orders`.

The order will follow this format:
![Discord_DjhgngTbln](uploads/ab6cd618bd4283da789edc85f6685d67/Discord_DjhgngTbln.png)

The first part is the ticket channel, in this case: `#test-friendliness`.
The second part is the customer's RSN, in this case: `Friendliness`.
The third part is the service they require, in this case: `Test`.
The fourth part is the amount of kills / tokens / ... they required, in this case: `1`.
The final part is the role you require to join said ticket, in this case: `@Test`.

__Note__: If a ticket has no fixed amount of kills, tokens, etc. it will say `#`.



As you can see there are also 3 buttons available on every order.

![inv](uploads/9b71b54283bfc224504cfcfa180fc60a/inv.webp) allows you to join the ticket if you have the required role.

![check](uploads/376f1f8b2a0ce34e02a9daf4aa5cdb72/check.webp) marks the order as completed.

![x.svg](uploads/afd57cce23c3226b4142264f1adf55d3/x.svg) deletes the order - mainly used when a customer cancels their order or when the amount .



## Step By Step
- If you spot an order you're interested in, click the 
![inv](uploads/9b71b54283bfc224504cfcfa180fc60a/inv.webp) button to join it.
- Now you're able to talk with the customer to discuss a suitable time for you both.
- Form your team in `#sellers` or `#skilling-sellers`

Once the service is completed, click the ![check](uploads/376f1f8b2a0ce34e02a9daf4aa5cdb72/check.webp) button to mark the order as completed.

__Note__: If the service listed `#` as amount, it's important to not hit ![check](uploads/376f1f8b2a0ce34e02a9daf4aa5cdb72/check.webp)! The reason for this is that this is an undefined amount of kills, which would then be added to our spreadsheet.

Instead, you would hit ![x.svg](uploads/afd57cce23c3226b4142264f1adf55d3/x.svg) to remove the order and then head to `#add-to-completed` and manually send in the service you completed along with the exact amount you sold.
